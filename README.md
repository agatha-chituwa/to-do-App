Since I use a to-do list on a daily basis, I decided to build this to-do app that looks like an A4 paper design.

I used HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to achieve this.

For JavaScript...

First, I declared an empty array. This will be used to keep the user input entered by the user.
Then, I created a function to grab user input using a submit event listener.
Finally, I used JavaScript templating to loop through the array to display them in checkboxes.
